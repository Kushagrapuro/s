# Design Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Minimalism
- Embrace whitespace as a design element
- Include only what is absolutely necessary
- Remove all decorative elements that don't serve a functional purpose
- When in doubt, remove rather than add

### Premium Aesthetics
- Use high contrast elements (black on white, white on black)
- Employ clean typography with proper spacing
- Prefer rounded shapes for interactive elements
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment

### Inspiration
- Follow design patterns from premium products like Notion and Spotify
- Prioritize clean, uncluttered interfaces
- Use subtle animations and transitions
- Avoid flashy or game-like elements

## UI Components

### Buttons
- Use rounded buttons (rounded-full for primary actions)
- Keep button text concise and action-oriented
- Implement subtle hover states (opacity changes preferred)
- Include proper focus states for accessibility
- Avoid excessive shadows or 3D effects

### Typography
- Use a clean, modern sans-serif font
- Maintain a clear hierarchy with limited font sizes
- Prefer lighter font weights for larger text
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background

### Colors
- Primary palette: Black, white, and shades of gray
- Use color sparingly and purposefully
- Maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Implement proper dark mode inversions

### Layout
- Center important actions
- Use a clean grid system
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Allow for proper breathing room around elements

## Interaction Design

### Feedback
- Provide subtle visual feedback on interaction
- Use opacity or slight color changes for hover states
- Implement smooth, subtle transitions
- Avoid flashy animations or effects

### Accessibility
- Include proper focus indicators
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make interactive elements appropriately sized
- Support keyboard navigation

## What to Avoid

### Excessive Elements
- Multiple containers or nested boxes
- Decorative icons or graphics that don't serve a purpose
- Headers or text that isn't absolutely necessary
- Borders or dividers unless needed for clarity

### Visual Noise
- Gradients or complex backgrounds
- Multiple colors or color variations
- Shadows or 3D effects
- Animations that distract rather than guide

### Complexity
- Nested or complex layouts
- Multiple interactive elements when one would suffice
- Unnecessary information or options
- Anything that distracts from the primary action
